# Introduce

`Strve.js` is a JS library that can convert strings into views. The string here refers to the template string, so you only need to develop the view in `JavaScript`. `Strve.js` is not only easy to use, but also easy to flexibly disassemble and assemble different code blocks.

If you want to get started with the project, please see how to install it below!
